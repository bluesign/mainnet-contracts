/*
This tool adds a new entitlemtent called TMP_ENTITLEMENT_OWNER to some functions that it cannot be sure if it is safe to make access(all)
those functions you should check and update their entitlemtents ( or change to all access )

Please see: 
https://cadence-lang.org/docs/cadence-migration-guide/nft-guide#update-all-pub-access-modfiers

IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE
Please familiarize yourself with the new entitlements feature because it is extremely important for you to understand in order to build safe smart contracts.
If you change pub to access(all) without paying attention to potential downcasting from public interfaces, you might expose private functions like withdraw 
that will cause security problems for your contract.

	Description: Central Collection for a large number of OlympicPin
				 NFTs

	This resource object looks and acts exactly like a OlympicPin PieceCollection
	and (in a sense) shouldnâ€™t have to exist! 

	The problem is that Cadence currently has a limitation where 
	storing more than ~100k objects in a single dictionary or array can fail.

	Most PieceCollections are likely to be much, much smaller than this, 
	and that limitation will be removed in a future iteration of Cadence, 
	so most people will never need to worry about it.

	However! The main OlympicPin administration account DOES need to worry about it
	because it frequently needs to mint >10k Pieces for sale,
	and could easily end up needing to hold more than 100k Piece at one time.
	
	Until Cadence gets an update, that leaves us in a bit of a pickle!

	This contract bundles together a bunch of PieceCollection objects 
	in a dictionary, and then distributes the individual Pieces between them 
	while implementing the same public interface 
	as the default PieceCollection implementation. 

	If we assume that piece IDs are uniformly distributed,
	a ShardedCollection with 10 inner Collections should be able 
	to store 10x as many pieces (or ~1M).

	When Cadence is updated to allow larger dictionaries, 
	then this contract can be retired.
