/*
The Pinnacle contract introduces five entities that establish the requirements for minting Pinnacle Pin NFTs and
organizing their metadata: Edition Types, Series, Sets, Shapes, and Editions.

These entities are defined as struct types, created by the Admin, and stored in arrays in the contract state.
Edition Types and Series are independent from other entities. Sets, Shapes, and Editions are linked to a
parent entity: a Series, Set, or Shape, respectively. Sets are also linked to a parent Edition Type.

Pinnacle Pin NFTs are minted from Editions. Owners have the option to add an Inscription to their NFT. The NFTs
adhere to the Flow NFT standard. Any Flow account can create a Collection to store Pinnacle Pin NFTs, which
includes functionality for Inscriptions and XP balance.

An Admin resource is created in the contract's init function. It is meant to be saved in the Admin's account
and provides the following key abilities:

- Create new entities (Edition Types, Series, Sets, Shapes, and Editions).
- Lock Series and Sets, preventing the creation of new child Sets and Shapes, respectively.
- Close Shapes, preventing the creation of new child Editions, Open/Unlimited Editions, preventing the
minting of new NFTs from those Editions, and Edition Types, preventing the creation of new child Sets, Shapes,
and Editions.
- Unlock or reopen entities within the undo period.
- Update the name of Series, Sets, and Shapes, as well as the description of Editions.
- Increment the current printing of Shapes unless they are closed.
- Mint NFTs, subject to the conditions defined in the contract, and deposit them in any account.
- Update an Inscription's note with owner co-signing if the owner has added an Inscription to their NFT.
- Update an NFT's XP balance unless the owner has revoked this ability.
- Create new Admins.

Notes:

- All functions will fail if an invalid argument is provided or one of the pre- or post-conditions are not
met. For getter functions, calls to non-existing objects are considered valid and will return nil so that they
can be handled differently by the caller. The borrowNFT function in the Collection resource is an exception to
that pattern, the borrowNFTSafe or borrowPinNFT function can be used instead.
- All dates specified in the contract are Unix timestamps.
