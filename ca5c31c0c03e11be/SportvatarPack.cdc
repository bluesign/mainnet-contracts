/*

 This contract defines the Sportvatar Packs and a Collection to manage them.

 Each Pack will contain one item for each required Component (body, hair, eyes, nose, mouth, clothing),
 and two other Components that are optional (facial hair, accessory, hat, eyeglasses, background).

 Packs will be pre-minted and can be purchased from the contract owner's account by providing a
 verified signature that is different for each Pack (more info in the purchase function).

 Once purchased, packs cannot be re-sold and users will only be able to open them to receive
 the contained Components into their collection.
